# _template 

Just a template you can copy when you want to add a new binaries to the system.

Try to keep this up to date.

The golang code it uses is: https://github.com/gedw99/simple-go-helloworld
The Module is: github.com/gedw99/simple-go-helloworld

Its just a simple web server and docker.

The docker is setup to copy the linux amd64 into the docker
- easier
- aligned with later updating the binary inside the docker via NATS etc

I can work this up further as i need to for testing different base thngs.
