# google sheets

so i have it compiling.

But i need a standard way to setup and connect to google.

there are golang projects that have this.

I need to get that going, and eventually a HTMX GUI or GIO GUI to make it easy for usrs.

see cmd/tokengen, where it has lots of args to do the work for me.

credentials.json is used by it
